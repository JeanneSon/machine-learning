notebooks on machine learning
This is just one example of what we did in the lecture on machine learning. For now, the programming assignment 3 is provided.
Unfortunately, the Jupyter Notebook did not load at all, so the notebook is now in the HTML format. The preview in GitHub though, is not very good.
